# Offering Solutions Angular Course (OSAC) Preparations

## Things you need to bring to get started with the course

1. Dropbox - Account
2. PC / Laptop (if the course is done via Digicomp PCs are already there and you are good to go)
3. Enthusiasm and the will to learn something new :-)

## Needed Installations

### If you come with your own laptop please make sure you installed the following pices of software to your PC:

* [Git](#git)
* [Node & npm](#node-with-npm)
* [Typescript](#typescript)
* [Yarn (not necessary)](#yarn)

### Git

You can get git on [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and check if you installed git via typing 

`git`

on your commandline. Something like this should appear:

![git](../.github/git.png "git")

### Node with npm

You can get node at [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it normally. After doing this make sure you can type

`node -v`

![node](../.github/nodeversion.png "node")

and

`npm -v`

![npm](../.github/npmversion.png "npm")

on your console.

> The versions do not really matter at all but be sure that node version is greater than version 6!

### Typescript

You can get Typescript on [https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links](https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links) or by directly typing 

`npm install -g typescript`

on your commandline.

Please make sure that afterwards you are able to type

`tsc -v`

on your commandline seeing something like this:

![tsc](../.github/tsc.png "tsc")


### Yarn (not necessary but nice to have)

You can get Yarn on [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). Please follow the installation instructions there.

Please make sure that afterwards you are able to type

`yarn`

on your commandline seeing something like this:

![yarn](../.github/yarn.png "yarn")

Do not be scared about the error. We will explain everything about that in the course.
